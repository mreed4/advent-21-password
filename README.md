This was another fun project to implement a password generator. I had some ideas in my mind of how it could work, and the reality was more or less in line with that idea. Basically, there is a default pool of possible characters. Groups of characters can be removed from the pool, and re-added to the pool. A password is randomly generated each time the user makes a change to the pool, or to the desired length of the password.

I added some keyboard events to make this even more interactive. I also added a button that when clicked will generate a password with the current settings. Oddly that button was not in the provided files, but I thought it was a good idea to add it.
