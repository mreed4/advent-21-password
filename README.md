This was another fun project to implement a password generator. I had som eideas in my mind of how it could work, and the reality was more or less in line with that idea. Basically, there is a default pool of possible characters. Groups of characters can be removed from the pool, and readded to the pool. A password is randomly geenrated each time the user makes a change to the pool, or to the desired length of the password.

I also added some keyboard events to make this even more interactive.
